# nlp-spellcheck

This repository contains code and training text data needed to run a basic spellcheck program as created by Peter Norvig (see http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html).  His code has been extended with bigram_spellcheck.py to use bigram frequencies rather than unigram frequencies for candidate word selection.

To run:

1. download all files to a single directory
2. open bigram_spellcheck.py in a python shell
3. run the bigram_correct(prevWord, word) function from the python shell
